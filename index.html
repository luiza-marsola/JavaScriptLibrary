    <h1>Milo<i class="fas fa-dog"></h1> 

    <p> This is my son Milo. He is a black, white and beige Shetland Sheepdog of almost to years old and 
        pretty much the only thing that matters. He loves making friends with other dogs, kids and women but
        absolutely hates men and won't let them come near him.
    </p>

    <p> He's not much of a guard dog as he is scared of pretty much everything, but he does love his toys, belly 
        rubs and mangos (as you can see in the picture bellow, he would often steal mangos from our mango tree and we would
        find out by looking at his yellow paws).
